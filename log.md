# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- **GraphQL**: updated small side project with new models and some relations.

    - **Thoughts:** to be fair i don't know the tradeoffs to use GraphQL, just trying to learn, but to write every model with nexus is kinda verbose, but i think it gets less boring with time.

    - **Commit**: [Add new models](https://github.com/cdbm/bolao-api-graphql/commit/8681d8dfb0e606396cacb95deedbe938e7920cc6)

- **Frontend Mentor QR code component**: coded the challenge to make a responsive qr code component using html and css.

    - **Thoughts:** it was good to brush up some css, but still thinking if this aproach will help me with css concepts or if i will be searching "center div" forever, let's see;

    - **Project**: [QR code component](https://github.com/cdbm/frontend-challenges/tree/main/qr-code-component)

### Day 2: February 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

- **Frontend Mentor NFT card component**: started the challenge to make a responsive NFT card component.

    - **Thoughts:** kinda like the yersteday's one but this thime I centered using flexbox so it's a advance.
